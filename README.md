# HelloWorld
Obviously, my first repo.  I am learning GitHub and Python and want to create a demo web site.

My name is Bruce.  I am an IT professional with 30+ uears experience, mostly as an IT infrastructure architect, though the last few years I've spent in an enlightening position of IT Operations, including as a servicedesk manager and as a servicedesk lead.

I have recently expended considerable time and effort studying for the Amazon Web Services Solution Architect - Associate exam, passed the exam, and am seeking employment as a Cloud Architect in operations or pre-sales.
